# SQL Database Analysis: E-commerce Sales Performance

## 📋 Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce company's sales data using SQL JOINs and Window Functions to derive business insights for strategic decision-making.

### 📊 Business Context
- **Company Type:** E-commerce retail company
- **Department:** Sales & Marketing Analytics
- **Industry:** Online consumer electronics retail

### 🎯 Data Challenge
Our company needs to analyze customer purchasing behavior and product performance across different regions to optimize inventory allocation and marketing campaigns. We're struggling to:
- Identify which products are underperforming in specific regions
- Track customer lifetime value effectively
- Gain insights into purchase patterns for accurate demand forecasting

### 📈 Expected Outcomes
1. Identify top-performing products per region for targeted promotions
2. Segment customers into value tiers for personalized marketing
3. Provide month-over-month sales trends to inform inventory planning
4. Detect products with no sales for potential discontinuation
5. Calculate running revenue metrics for real-time performance tracking

## 🗄️ Database Schema Design

## Database Schema
![img.png](img.png)
The database schema is designed to support sales analysis across regions, customers, products, and transactions.
The ER diagram below illustrates the relationships between the main entities.


### Table Structures
```sql
-- Regions Table
CREATE TABLE regions (
    region_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    region_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    manager_id NUMBER,
    sales_target NUMBER(12,2) DEFAULT 100000.00
);

-- Customers Table  
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    region VARCHAR2(50),
    region_id NUMBER,
    signup_date DATE NOT NULL,
    customer_tier VARCHAR2(20) CHECK (customer_tier IN ('Bronze', 'Silver', 'Gold', 'Platinum')),
    FOREIGN KEY (region_id) REFERENCES regions(region_id)
);

-- Products Table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    price NUMBER(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (price > 0),
    cost NUMBER(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (cost >= 0),
    supplier_id NUMBER,
    created_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

-- Transactions Table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id NUMBER,
    product_id NUMBER,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    quantity NUMBER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    unit_price NUMBER(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (unit_price > 0),
    total_amount NUMBER(10,2),
    payment_method VARCHAR2(30),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
